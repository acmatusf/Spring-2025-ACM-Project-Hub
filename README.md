# Spring-2025-ACM-Project-Hub
## Project Hub Overview

snAkeCM is a project developed by the Spring 2025 USF ACM Project Hub team. In this project, we’re building our own version of the classic Snake game using Python. However, rather than simply recreating Snake, we’re challenging ourselves to add new, member-suggested twists like walls that switch between being barriers and open paths to make the game more interesting.

This project is designed to help students learn by doing. Instead of traditional workshops, our role is to guide you as you collaborate through Discord and GitHub. By working on this project together, you’ll gain hands-on experience in coding, teamwork, and making documentation.

Our end goal is to showcase the project in a final event where you can present your work. This isn’t just about making a game; it’s about building a project that demonstrates your skills and looks great on your resume, boosting your internship chances and paving the way for future Project Hubs.

Pause menu: 
  Now the user can press ESC to stop the game and a menu will show up with options: Resume - unpause the game, Restart - start the game over with a score 0, Change Bg (Background) - by pressing ENTER the background changes, Music On/Off - the music turns on and off by pressing ENTER, Exit - for now it quits the game completely, for the future it is supposed to send the user back to the main menu (main menu is not implemented yet).
