# Spring-2025-ACM-Project-Hub
## Project Hub Overview

snAkeCM is a project developed by the Spring 2025 USF ACM Project Hub team. In this project, we‚Äôre building our own version of the classic Snake game using Python. However, rather than simply recreating Snake, we‚Äôre challenging ourselves to add new, member-suggested twists like walls that switch between being barriers and open paths to make the game more interesting.

This project is designed to help students learn by doing. Instead of traditional workshops, our role is to guide you as you collaborate through Discord and GitHub. By working on this project together, you‚Äôll gain hands-on experience in coding, teamwork, and making documentation.

Our end goal is to showcase the project in a final event where you can present your work. This isn‚Äôt just about making a game; it‚Äôs about building a project that demonstrates your skills and looks great on your resume, boosting your internship chances and paving the way for future Project Hubs.

If you would like to play the game, simply download the "snAkeCM.zip" file, extract it, select "dist" folder, and open "snake.exe". *Hint*: To unlock challenge mode, you need to score 15 points in Hard mode and 20 points in Normal mode. And there's a secret reward for beating challenge mode

In this branch, among the changes made from the first ever version of the game, there are:
- Before starting the game, you have to write your name (only in Classic Mode Hard difficulty), and your score is shown in the top left of the screen. After you lose, your name and score gets stored in a json file so it can be used or shown later. At the same time, your name and score gets printed in the terminal whenever you die as well.
- Now, if you go you go out of bounds, you get teleported to the other side of the board.
- Bug fixes include that now apples do not spawn in your body, and you don't kill yourself by moving more than once per frame, since the snake only moves once per frame.
- In stage 2 of challenge mode (4 <= score < 10, where score is number of apples eaten), reverse direction of the snake every time the snake eats an apple

"Resume", "Restart", "Change BG", "Music On/Off", "Back to MM"
- Pause menu: Now the user can press ESC to stop the game and a menu will show up with options: Resume - unpause the game, Restart - start the game over with a score 0, Change BG (Background) - by pressing ENTER the background changes, Music On/Off - the music turns on and off by pressing ENTER, Back to MM - returns to the main menu to select either Classic Mode, Challenge Mode, or Quit to quit the game.
- ScoreBoard: The screen is divided into two parts: a black rectangle on top with the current user's score and the play area itself.
- Font: The chosen font for all text in the game is Press Start 2P.
- Added random obstacles (fixed death blocks below) that randomly spawns which kills the snake upon collision in stage 3 of challenge mode (10 <= score < 17)

- Main Menu: Menu to select modes before starting the game and title screen
- Difficulty modes in classic mode: Changes speed settings to match assigned difficulty within classic mode
- Death blocks (not included into final due to breaking game): Blocks that would kill the player upon contact, spawned until 5 were on the map at which point the oldest one in the group would change position.

Speed up and teleporting apple for challenge mode
- In challenge mode, in stage 4, aka if your score (the number of apples eaten) is >= 17 and < 19, you significantly speed up
- In stage 5, aka if your score is >= 19 and < 24, the apples randomly teleport every 5 seconds (gotta go fast lol)
